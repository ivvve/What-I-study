## be supposed to ~
- I'm supposed to deal with it.
- You're not supposed to touch this screen with your hands.
- Am I supposed to do this job?
- Were you supposed to bring the box here?
- Aren't you supposed to go home now?

## Be ~ ?
- Are you available now?
- Are they in Korea?
- Weren't you worried about it?
- Aren't you busy with your job now?
- Is WAVE famous in France?


## Just because ~, doesn't mean ~
- Just because I'm younger than you, doesn't mean I can't work better than you.
- Just because he is strong, doesn't mean he can open this bottle.
- Just because my phone is an old model, doesn't mean I can't play WAVE with you.
- Just because she is as famous as celebrities, doesn't mean she is pretty.
- Just because it's cold outside, doesn't mean I don't want to drink iced ameriano.
